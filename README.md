# Bizarre Engine

My first attempt to make a game engine in Rust. It's will be definitely a very
strange, pretty possibly obnoxious in some aspects, and overall bizarre piece of
software.

The sole purpose of that venture is to conceptualize principals of game engine
building and maybe make something interesting along the way.

I mostly trying to make everything from scratch where it possible, because
reinventing the wheel is fun.

As you can see the project is **highly** in WIP state both from concept and
implementation perspective. Rest assured, we are working on it.

## Rough road map 

- [x] Logging
- [ ] Debug Assertions with clean shutdown
- [ ] Application System model *(layers?)*
- [ ] Window creation
- [ ] Input handling
- [ ] Event system
- [ ] Rendering
  - [ ] Vulkan Renderer
- [ ] Mutlithreading
- [ ] ECS
- [ ] Asset management
- [ ] Scene management and serialization
- [ ] Physics
- [ ] Audio
- [ ] Scripting
- [ ] Editor

Somewhere in between there will be some of those:

- [ ] Custom user interface for in-engine and in-game use
- [ ] AI?
- [ ] DirectX support?
- [ ] Metal support?
- [ ] OpenGl???
